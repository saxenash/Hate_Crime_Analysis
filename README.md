# Hate_Crime_Analysis
Hate Crime - The Hate Crime Statistics dataset provides annual statistics (of US states) on the number of incidents, offenses, victims, and offenders in reported crimes that are motivated in whole, or in part, by an offender’s bias against the victim’s perceived race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. This dataset has Information about Hate Crime Data at Incident level. It also has single-bias and multiple-bias hate crimes. A single-bias incident is an incident in which one or more offense types are motivated by the same bias. Multiple-bias incident is the one with one or more offense types are motivated by two or more biases.  For this project,  State level data was used. Other-lower level data was rejected. Only Single Bias Hate crimes were used.
